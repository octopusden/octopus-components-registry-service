== Overview
Components Registry is a registry of all link:{glossary-component-link}[components] developed in R&D.
It keeps basic parameters of components required for organizing automated release management and Escrow package generation.

WARNING: All components must be registered in link:{components-registry-link}[Components Registry]!

Components Registry stores the following information about Components:

* Release Management parameters (used for automated link:{release-management-automation-link}[registration of releases and generation of client release notes])
** Desired JIRA Project Key
** Major version format in JIRA
** Release version format in JIRA
** VCS repository url
** VCS repository branch
** VCS repository release tag format
* Build/Escrow parameters (used for link:{escrow-automation-tool-link}[Escrow package generation])
** build system (Maven, Gradle etc)
** groupId/artifactId of artifacts produced and published in Artifactory at each release (*it's recommended to use unique groupId for the component*)
** java version required for build escrow component
** additional system properties for maven build
* Distribution type and distribution artifacts coordinates

== Information to be provided for registration of Component
WARNING: In case of difficulties with manual registration of component, raise a public ticket in link:{service-desk-link}[Service Desk].

Example:
----
component name: 'NewComponent'
component owner: <username>

jira project key  = 'NEW'
majorVersionFormat = '$major.$minor'
releaseVersionFormat = '$major.$minor.$service-$fix'

groupId = 'org.company.newcomponent'
artifact = *  // i.e. all artifacts

vcsUrl = 'ssh://git@git.company.org/newproject/newcomponent.git'
build system = MAVEN
java version = '11'

distribution:
explicit = true/false
external = true/false
//for explicit/external specify artifacts to be published in DMS
<artifacts coordinates>
----

== How to register/change Component configuration manually
Source is located in link:{components-registry-link}[git repository].

* Clone repository
* Create branch with name of a corresponding JIRA issue key
* Add/Change component configuration to the specific file in _src/main/resources_
* Commit and push changes
* Check (after several minutes) that the new version of configuration has been successfully validated (link:{components-registry-validation-link}[Components Registry Validation])
* In case of success, create Pull Request, then wait for approvals and merge it

== Component configuration format
Components Registry is originally stored as configuration files with ConfigSlurper groovy format.

Each Component must be configured in corresponding configuration file according to following format:
----
<component name> {
        buildSystem = <build tool> // MAVEN, GRADLE etc. (default for all versions)

        vcsSettings {
           vcsUrl = <vsc url> // Repository url. (default for all versions)
           branch = <branch> // Repository branch. If not specified "master" is used. (default for all versions)
           tag = <format of vcs tag> // Tag used for releases labelling. (can be configured using Expression Language) (default for all versions)
        }

        groupId = <groupId list> // Comma-separated list of groupId of artifacts that belongs to the component. It's recommended to use unique groupId. (default for all versions)
        artifactId = <artifactId regexp pattern> // artifactId regex pattern of artifacts that belongs to the component. (default for all versions)

        jira { // Parameters releated to build/release registration in JIRA and generation of client release notes (default for all versions)
            projectKey = <JIRA project key>
            majorVersionFormat = <format of major version in JIRA> (can be configured using Expression Language)
            releaseVersionFormat = <format of release version for registration in JIRA> (can be configured using Expression Language)
        }

        build { // Parameters related to escrow build (default for all versions)
            javaVersion = <java version>
            systemProperties = <additional properties for maven build>
        }

        distribution { // Distribution parameters (default for all versions)
            explicit = <true|false>
            external = <true|false>
            GAV = <MAVEN distribution artifacts> (can be configured using Expression Language)
            DEB = <DEBIAN distribution artifacts> (can be configured using Expression Language)
            RPM = <RPM distribution artifacts> (can be configured using Expression Language)
            docker = <Docker distribution image> (one image per component)(example: 'test/test-component')
        }

    "<version range 1>" {  // configuration of the component for first range of version
        buildSystem = <build tool> // MAVEN, GRADLE etc. (for specific version range)

        vcsSettings {
           vcsUrl = <vsc url> // Repository url. (for specific version range)
           branch = <branch> // Repository branch. If not specified "master" is used. (for specific version range)
           tag = <format of vcs tag> // Tag used for releases labelling. (can be configured using Expression Language) (for specific version range)
        }

        groupId = <groupId list> // Comma-separated list of groupId of artifacts that belongs to the component. It's recommended to use unique groupId. (for specific version range)
        artifactId = <artifactId regexp pattern> // artifactId regex pattern of artifacts that belongs to the component. (for specific version range)

        jira { // Parameters releated to build/release registration in JIRA and generation of client release notes (for specific version range)
            projectKey = <JIRA project key>
            majorVersionFormat = <format of major version in JIRA> (can be configured using Expression Language)
            releaseVersionFormat = <format of release version for registration in JIRA> (can be configured using Expression Language)
        }

        build { // Parameters related to escrow build (for specific version range)
            javaVersion = <java version>
            systemProperties = <additional properties for maven build>
        }

        distribution { // Distribution parameters (for specific version range)
            explicit = <true|false>
            external = <true|false>
            GAV = <MAVEN distribution artifacts> (can be configured using Expression Language)
            DEB = <DEBIAN distribution artifacts> (can be configured using Expression Language)
            RPM = <RPM distribution artifacts> (can be configured using Expression Language)
            docker = <Docker distribution image> (one image per component)(example: 'test/test-component')
        }
    }
    "<version range 2>" {
            // Configuration of the component for the second range of version
    }
    ...
    "<version range N>" {
            // Configuration of the component for the N range of version
    }
}

=== Version ranges
Different configurations of component depending on version of its release are supported.
It can be configured using version range section in configuration of the component.
For each component at least one version range section should be defined.
Version range section defines configuration of the component for versions that matches version range specified in the name of the section.
Version range has Maven 2.x/3.x format.

Examples of version range:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|(,1.0]
|version \<= 1.0

|[1.0]
|version = 1.0

|(,1.0],[1.2,)
|version \<= 1.0 or version >= 1.2

|(,1.1),(1.1,)
|version <> 1.1
|===

*ALL_VERSIONS* constant can also be used as "no limit" version range.

WARNING: Version ranges of a component should have no intersections!

=== Multiple release branches
If your component uses multiple release branches (e.g. Cards, Way4Web), then you need to configure a version range for each release branch.

=== Expression Language
The rules of how to calculate major/release version and some other fields by a build version can be configured using Expression Language.

Basic variables are:

* *$component* - component name
* *$version* - component build version

The component build version is parsed and split into the items which can be referred with following variables:

* *$major* - first item of the build version
* *$minor* - second item of the build version
* *$service* - third item of the build version
* *$fix* - forth item of the build version
* *$major02* - first item of the build version in format %02d
* *$minor02* - second item of the build version in format %02d
* *$service02* - third item of the build version in format %02d
* *$fix02* - forth item of the build version in format %02d

WARNING: One should use single-quoted `String` with Expression Language statements. Using of double-quoted `GString` may lead to clash with standard Groovy template engine.

=== Distribution section
The distribution section of the component configuration describes how the component is distributed.

Below is the list of available parameters:

* *explicit* - indicates whether component has its own distribution (true/false)
* *external* - indicates whether component is delivered to external customer or used only internally (true/false)
* *GAV* - comma-separated list of MAVEN distribution artifacts
* *DEB* - comma-separated list of DEBIAN distribution artifacts
* *RPM* - comma-separated list of RPM distribution artifacts
* *docker* - name of Docker distribution image(one image per component)(example: 'test/test-component')

*GAV*, *DEB* and *RPM* parameters can be configured using Expression Language with following variables:

WARNING: *GAV* and/or *DEB* and/or *RPM* parameter should be defined for *external* *explicit* component!

==== MAVEN artifacts configuration
Each artifact can be either:

* loaded from MAVEN storage (then one should specify MAVEN GAV *except version*)
* taken from local FS on build agent and uploaded to MAVEN storage (then one should specify file URL)

File URL can be extended with query parameters *artifactId* and/or *classifier* (that affects calculation of MAVEN GAV to be used for uploading).

Example:
----
GAV='org.company.newcomponent:artifact:jar,file:///target/application-${version}.exe?artifactId=NewComponent'
