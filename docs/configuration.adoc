== Overview
Components Registry is a registry of all link:{glossary-component-link}[components] developed in the organization.
It keeps basic parameters of components required for organizing automated release management and Escrow package generation.

WARNING: All components must be registered in link:{components-registry-link}[Components Registry]!

Components Registry stores the following information about Components:

* Release Management parameters (used for automated link:{release-management-automation-link}[registration of releases and generation of client release notes])
** Desired JIRA Project Key
** Major version format in JIRA
** Release version format in JIRA
** VCS repository url
** VCS repository branch
** VCS repository release tag format
* Build/Escrow parameters (used for link:{escrow-automation-tool-link}[Escrow package generation])
** build system (Maven, Gradle etc)
** groupId/artifactId of artifacts produced and published in Artifactory at each release (*it's recommended to use unique groupId for the component*)
** java version required for build escrow component
** additional system properties for maven/gradle build
* Distribution type and distribution artifacts coordinates

== Information to be provided for registration of Component
WARNING: In case of difficulties with manual registration of component, raise a public ticket in link:{service-desk-link}[Service Desk].

Example:
----
component name: 'NewComponent'
component owner: <username>

jira project key  = 'NEW'
majorVersionFormat = '$major.$minor'
releaseVersionFormat = '$major.$minor.$service-$fix'

groupId = 'org.company.newcomponent'
artifact = *  // i.e. all artifacts

vcsUrl = 'ssh://git@git.company.org/newproject/newcomponent.git'
build system = MAVEN
java version = '11'

distribution:
explicit = true/false
external = true/false
//for explicit/external specify artifacts to be published in DMS
<artifacts coordinates>
----

== How to register/change Component configuration manually
Source is located in link:{components-registry-link}[git repository].

* Clone repository
* Create branch with name of a corresponding JIRA issue key
* Add/Change component configuration to the specific file in _src/main/resources_
* Commit and push changes
* Check (after several minutes) that the new version of configuration has been successfully validated (link:{components-registry-validation-link}[Components Registry Validation])
* In case of success, create Pull Request, then wait for approvals and merge it

== Component configuration format
Components Registry is originally stored as configuration files with ConfigSlurper groovy format.

Each Component must be configured in corresponding configuration file according to following format:
----
<component id> {
        componentDisplayName = "Name of component" //  display name of the component, e.g. in DMS
        parentComponent      = <component id> // grouping components in DMS
        clientCode           = <client code> // if component is client specific
        solution             = <true|false> // true for solution

        componentOwner   = "username of component's owner" // without domain part
        releaseManager   = "username of component's release manager"
        securityChampion = "username of component's security champion"

        buildSystem = <build tool> // MAVEN, GRADLE etc. (default for all versions)
        system      = <{system_name}> // used for differentiation between different corporate policies (license control, etc)
                                   
        vcsSettings {
           vcsUrl = <vsc url> // Repository url. (default for all versions, can be configured using Dynamic variables resolution)
           branch = <branch> // Repository branch. If not specified "master" is used (default for all versions, can be configured using Dynamic variables resolution)
           tag = <format of vcs tag> // Tag used for releases labelling (default for all versions, can be configured using Dynamic variables resolution)
        }

        groupId = <groupId list> // Comma-separated list of groupId of artifacts that belongs to the component. It's recommended to use unique groupId. (default for all versions)

        distribution { // Distribution parameters (default for all versions)
            explicit = <true|false> // true - self-distributed component

    }
}

=== Version ranges
Different configurations of component depending on version of its release are supported.
It can be configured using version range section in configuration of the component.
For each component at least one version range section should be defined.
Version range section defines configuration of the component for versions that matches version range specified in the name of the section.
Version range has Maven 2.x/3.x format.

Examples of version range:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|(,1.0]
|version \<= 1.0

|[1.0]
|version = 1.0

|(,1.0],[1.2,)
|version \<= 1.0 or version >= 1.2

|(,1.1),(1.1,)
|version <> 1.1
|===

*ALL_VERSIONS* constant can also be used as "no limit" version range.

WARNING: Version ranges of a component should have no intersections!

=== Version format
Base version formats like *majorVersionFormat* and *releaseVersionFormat* are configured using following variables:

* *$major* - first item of the build version
* *$major02* - first item of the build version in format %02d
* *$minor* - second item of the build version
* *$minor02* - second item of the build version in format %02d
* *$service* - third item of the build version
* *$service02* - third item of the build version in format %02d
* *$fix* - forth item of the build version
* *$fix02* - forth item of the build version in format %02d
* *$fix04* - forth item of the build version in format %04d
* *$build* - fifth item of the build version
* *$build02* - fifth item of the build version in format %02d
* *$build04* - fifth item of the build version in format %04d

Jira version format defined by *versionFormat* is extended version of base format that is configured using following variables:

* *$versionPrefix* - version prefix
* *$baseVersionFormat* - base version format

Usually it has value *$versionPrefix-$baseVersionFormat*

=== Dynamic variables resolution

Following parameters support dynamic variables resolution:

* *vcsUrl*
* *branch*
* *tag*
* *buildFilePath*
* *systemProperties*

Available variables are:

* all base version format variables (refer to Version format, extended version format variables like *$baseVersionFormat* are not supported)
* *$module* - component name
* *$version* - component build version
* *$cvsCompatibleVersion* - the same as *$version* but all dots are replaced with hyphen-minus symbols
* *$cvsCompatibleUnderscoreVersion* - the same as *$version* but all dots are replaced with underscores

Example:
----
tag = '$module-$major02.$minor02.$service02'
----

=== Multiple release branches
If your component uses multiple release branches, specify them in the `branch` parameter, separated by the `|` symbol.

Example:
----
branch = 'master|release/$major.$minor'
----

=== Distribution section
The distribution section of the component configuration describes how the component is distributed.

Below is the list of available parameters:

* *explicit* - indicates whether component has its own distribution (true/false)
* *external* - indicates whether component is delivered to external customer or used only internally (true/false)
* *GAV* - comma-separated list of MAVEN artifact coordinates
* *DEB* - comma-separated list of DEBIAN artifact coordinates
* *RPM* - comma-separated list of RPM artifact coordinates
* *docker* - comma-separated list of Docker image coordinates where image tag implicitly starts with a component version and optionally ends with a specified suffix (e.g. `:arm64` after evaluation with version  `:1.2.3` will become `:1.2.3-arm64`)

*GAV*, *DEB*, and *RPM* parameters can be configured using Expression Language.

WARNING: At least one of *GAV*, *DEB*, *RPM*, *docker* parameters should be defined for *external* *explicit* component!

==== Expression Language
The rules of how to calculate distribution coordinates can be configured using Expression Language.

Available variables are:

* *${component}* - component name
* *${version}* - component build version
* *${major}* - first item of the build version
* *${minor}* - second item of the build version
* *${service}* - third item of the build version
* *${fix}* - forth item of the build version
* *${build}* - fifth item of the build version
* *${env.<NAME>}* - <NAME> environment variable
* *${baseDir}* - user.dir system property

==== MAVEN artifacts configuration
Each artifact can be either:

* loaded from MAVEN storage (then one should specify MAVEN GAV *except version*)
* taken from local FS on build agent and uploaded to MAVEN storage (then one should specify file URL)

File URL can be extended with query parameters *artifactId* and/or *classifier* (that affects calculation of MAVEN GAV to be used for uploading).

Example:
----
GAV='org.company.newcomponent:artifact:jar,file:///target/application-${version}.exe?artifactId=NewComponent'
----
