# API Compat Deltas — Compat Surface, Known Deltas, Pre-flight

This doc explains how the `components-registry-compat-test` module decides what counts
as a compatibility regression between the v2 prod baseline and the v3 schema-v2 candidate,
and how to document intentional behavioral changes so they stop failing the build.

## Compat surface scope

The compat-test exercises **API contracts**:

- `GET /rest/api/2/components/{component}` and per-version detail endpoints
- `GET /rest/api/2/components/{component}/versions/{version}/{detailed-version,jira-component,build-tools}`
- `GET /rest/api/2/components/{component}/maven-artifacts`
- `GET /rest/api/2/projects/{project}/{distribution,component-distributions,jira-components,jira-component-version-ranges,vcs-settings}` (per-project + per-version)
- `GET /rest/api/2/common/jira-component-version-ranges`
- `POST /rest/api/2/components/find-by-artifact` and the batch detailed-versions endpoint
- `GET /rest/api/2/components-registry/service/ping` — plain-text behavioral contract
- `PUT /rest/api/2/components-registry/service/updateCache` — **phase-aware** contract: returns **200** + the Git-refresh duration (ms) while any component is still served from Git (migration-status `git > 0`), and **410 Gone** only once fully migrated to the DB (`git == 0`). A fully-migrated db-mode candidate returns 410 → suppressed via `known-deltas-db.json`; a git-mode (no-migration) candidate returns 200 and matches baseline → no delta. See "Per-mode known-deltas" below.
- `GET /components` list / `GET /components/{c}` detail / `GET /components/{c}/distribution` (v1/v2/v3) — the **component-level** `Component.distribution` and `escrow` fields report the **OPEN-UPPER (newest) block's** values (ADR-018 base-row amendment, 2026-07), not the top-level/oldest block's. Confirmed intentional by the domain owner 2026-07-01 over all 11 affected components; suppressed via the "ADR-018 base-row amendment" `known-deltas-db.json` entries until this release becomes the baseline. Per-VERSION endpoints are byte-identical (unaffected). The standalone `{c}/distribution` endpoint is deprecated (zero recorded prod traffic).

- **Jira display name** (`ADR-021`, 2026-09) — `JiraComponent.displayName` resolves
  `jiraDisplayName ?: displayName` instead of `jiraDisplayName` alone, so the 518 components that
  declare only a `componentDisplayName` now render their own name where the baseline rendered
  `null` (518 of 998 in the QA snapshot this was sized against; the prod figure will differ
  slightly). Surfaces carrying the embedded `component.displayName`: `.../versions/{v}/jira-component`,
  `projects/{p}/versions/{v}`, `components/{c}/versions/{v}` (the `DetailedComponent` endpoint, which
  carries it under `jiraComponentVersion.`) and both `jira-component-version-ranges` endpoints. Note
  `components/{c}` is **not** among them — `ComponentV2` has no jira block. Plus
  `DetailedComponentVersion.component` on `.../detailed-version` and the batch `detailed-versions`
  (it already read `displayName ?: componentName`, so it follows the same rule and flips from the key
  to the label for those components).
  On both `jira-component-version-ranges` endpoints the Set's element COUNT also rises: TD-022
  (`JiraComponentVersionRange.equals/hashCode` omit `componentName`) collapsed components whose
  payload was identical, and the resolved name separates them again. Accepted only when
  `Adr021RangeRecovery` confirms the collapse story element by element — see ADR-021.
  Neutralised at **field granularity only**: raw-layer `known-deltas-db.json` entries pinned to the
  `component.displayName` JSON path, and typed-layer field comparators (`*.displayName`, plus
  `component` scoped to the detailed-version endpoints). No ADR-021 entry uses `messagePattern`, so
  no whole typed record is suppressed and a co-occurring regression on the same payload still
  surfaces — pinned by the negative tests in `Adr021DisplayNameCompatTest`. **`known-deltas-git.json` stays
  empty**: the fallback is applied only on the DB resolver path, so a no-migration git-mode
  candidate is still byte-identical to the baseline and the deploy-without-migration invariant is
  untouched. The legacy `$.name` and every write-back surface are excluded from the rule by design
  — see the ADR — so this delta does not spread beyond the Jira-facing payloads.

**Operational metadata endpoints are explicitly excluded** from the compat surface:

- `GET /rest/api/2/components-registry/service/status` — read **only** by
  `SnapshotPreconditionTest` for two fields (`versionControlRevision`, `serviceMode`)
  via a local `ServiceStatusSnapshot` projection. The `cacheUpdatedAt` field is
  transient (per-run timestamp) and is not part of any contract.

Rationale: keeping transient runtime fields in the typed-DTO compare produces
per-run noise that future readers mistake for regressions, and fixing it inside
the comparator (field skip / sentinel value) is fragile.

## Pre-flight checklist before running compat-test

`./gradlew :components-registry-compat-test:test` is gated on the
`compat.baseline.url` Gradle property (or `COMPAT_BASELINE_URL` env var). Before
running, confirm:

1. **Both stands report the same `versionControlRevision`** on
   `GET /service/status`. Auto-checked by `SnapshotPreconditionTest`; mismatch
   records a `SNAPSHOT_MISMATCH` env-warning (fail-causing, not suppressible).
   Mechanism: each stand checks out the max-numeric tag matching its
   env-specific `components-registry.vcs.tagVersionPrefix`
   (`GitTagResolver.resolve()`); different prefix per env → different tag →
   different revision, **by design**. Align by configuring matching prefixes
   in `f1/service-config` or by waiting for both stands to pick up the same
   release tag.

2. **Candidate `cacheUpdatedAt` has been stable for at least a few minutes.**
   The candidate runs a periodic VCS clone+resolve cycle; running compat-test
   during that cycle produces a flood of transient `STRUCTURAL_DIFF` records as
   different requests see mid-refresh snapshots. Verify with two curls of
   `/service/status` ~30s apart — `cacheUpdatedAt` should not advance.

3. **Candidate's read path** (Git source vs DB source) must be verified
   out-of-band — there is currently no signal exposed in `ServiceStatusDTO`
   indicating which the candidate is using (the public `serviceMode` enum is
   `{FS, VCS}` only, the schema-v2 DB/Git selector is an internal switch via
   `ComponentSourceRegistry` / profile). **Critical**: if the candidate is
   serving from the legacy VCS code path, compat-test validates only that the
   candidate binary still reads VCS correctly — it does NOT validate the
   actual schema-v2 DB read-path. Any DB-read-path regressions are invisible
   in this configuration. Operator must confirm the candidate is in the
   intended mode before the run.

4. **Wipe `build/reports/compat/`** before re-runs. Per-worker ndjson files
   contain a UUID in the filename; old files would otherwise be merged into
   the new `summary.md` and double-count diffs. The `test` task's
   `doFirst` block now handles this automatically, and `outputs.upToDateWhen { false }`
   forces re-run.

## Per-mode known-deltas (db vs git)

The candidate can run in two modes, and the sanctioned deltas differ, so the
deltas live in **two files** selected by `-Pcompat.known-deltas` (or
`COMPAT_KNOWN_DELTAS`), default `known-deltas-db.json`:

| File | Candidate mode | Selected by | Contents |
|---|---|---|---|
| `known-deltas-db.json` | migrated, `default-source=db` (`git==0`) — id17 / `[1.7]` | default | the `updateCache` 410 delta (db-mode is fully migrated, so the endpoint is retired) |
| `known-deltas-git.json` | no-migration, `default-source=git` (`git>0`) — id18 / `[1.8]` | `-Pcompat.known-deltas=known-deltas-git.json` (set by `teamcity-run.sh` when `CANDIDATE_MODE=git`) | **intentionally empty** |

`known-deltas-git.json` is empty by design: in git-mode every v1/v2/v3 response
is served by the Git resolver — the same code path as the 2.0.87 baseline — and
phase-aware `updateCache` returns 200, so there are **no** sanctioned deviations.
This encodes the **deploy-without-migration no-op invariant**: any active diff in
git-mode is a real regression and must be fixed, never suppressed.

## Known-delta entry format

Each entry in the active known-deltas file (see "Per-mode known-deltas" above)
under `deltas[]`:

| Field | Required | Semantics |
|---|---|---|
| `endpoint` | one of endpoint / endpointPattern | Must match `DiffRecord.endpoint` exactly. Format: `"<METHOD> <path>"`, e.g. `"PUT /rest/api/2/components-registry/service/updateCache"`. The HTTP method is part of this string; there is no separate `method` field. |
| `endpointPattern` | one of endpoint / endpointPattern | Regex (`find()`) against `DiffRecord.endpoint`. For records whose endpoint embeds a LITERAL path value — the prod-trace replayer does not parameterize paths, so raw trace requests carry real component keys, which must NOT be committed to this public repo (CI Content Validation). Match the path SHAPE instead (e.g. `^GET /rest/api/[12]/components/[^/{}]+$` = any literal v1/v2 component-detail request; `{component}` template records are excluded by the brace class). An entry with NEITHER endpoint NOR endpointPattern never matches. If both are set, both must match. |
| `category` | yes | One of `STATUS_CODE_DIFF`, `HEADER_DIFF`, `STRUCTURAL_DIFF`, `VALUE_DIFF`, `NULL_VS_EMPTY` (see `DiffClassifier`). **Env categories (`SNAPSHOT_MISMATCH`, `CANDIDATE_NOT_DB_MODE` — the latter currently dormant) are not suppressible.** |
| `baselineValue` | no | Exact-match (string compare); `null` means "any". |
| `candidateValue` | no | Exact-match; `null` means "any". |
| `pathParams` | no | Map exact-match; `null` means "any". |
| `queryParams` | no | Map exact-match; `null` means "any". Required to distinguish e.g. `?ignore-required=true` from `?ignore-required=false` when only one of the two variants is intentional. |
| `jsonPathPattern` | no | Regex, matched with `find()` against the record's raw-layer `jsonPath` (e.g. `\$\.components\[\d+\]\.distribution\.(docker\|GAV)$` covers every array index). A specified pattern requires the record to CARRY a jsonPath and match — records with `jsonPath: null` never match, so the key narrows, never widens. For cluster-wide intentional deltas where per-`pathParams` entries would explode combinatorially. |
| `messagePattern` | no | Regex, matched with `find()` against the record's `message` (the typed-layer AssertJ text — typed records carry `jsonPath: null`, and the differing field appears only as `field/property 'x.y' differ`). Same narrowing semantics as `jsonPathPattern`. Keep patterns anchored to the differing-field clause, NOT to component names/values, so an entry documents a rule ("this field intentionally changed"), not a data snapshot. **Granularity caveat:** suppression is per RECORD, and one typed record = one whole AssertJ comparison — per-component on detail/v2-list compares (all differing fields of that component in one message), the ENTIRE collection on the v1 whole-list compare. A matching entry therefore also swallows co-occurring unrelated diffs inside the same record for its lifetime; state that blast radius in `reason`. |
| `reason` | yes | Free-text justification. Should reference the relevant code path and/or PR. |
| `regressionTest` | yes | UT method name in `ClassName.testMethodName` form (simple class name, no package prefix — e.g. `ComponentsRegistryServiceControllerUpdateCacheTest.git equal to zero retires the endpoint with 410 and does not re-read`) that pins the intended behavior. This is the contract that prevents the entry from going stale. |

## Categories of resolution

When a diff appears that wasn't there before, classify it as one of:

### 1. Intentional v3 change

Example: `C.1` — `PUT /service/updateCache` returns `410 Gone` on a **fully-migrated**
v3 candidate (fully migrated, `git==0`), where it was `200` on v2. This is the end-state of the
phase-aware endpoint: once every component lives in the DB, a manual Git re-read is
meaningless. (Note: this is a db-mode-only delta — a git-mode/no-migration candidate
still returns 200, matching v2, so it is NOT a delta there.)

**Procedure**:
1. Ship a regression UT that pins the intended behavior on the candidate side.
2. Add an entry to the appropriate per-mode file — normally `known-deltas-db.json` (migrated/db-mode candidate) — referencing that UT in `regressionTest`. `known-deltas-git.json` stays empty; a git-mode diff is a real regression, not a sanctioned delta. See "Per-mode known-deltas".
3. PR description justifies why this is intentional (link to ADR / spec / ticket).

### 2. Data drift after tag-revision divergence

Example: baseline returns one extra docker image in a project's
`distribution.docker` field that candidate omits — because each stand resolves
to a different `tagVersionPrefix` and catches different DSL revisions.

**Procedure**: NOT entered as a known-delta. Surfaces via `SNAPSHOT_MISMATCH`
precondition record (`SnapshotPreconditionTest`). Resolve at the operator level
by aligning the stands' configured prefixes or waiting for both to pick up the
same release tag. Drift is by design; do not paper over.

### 3. Operational metadata

Example: `/service/status` carries `cacheUpdatedAt` (per-stand timestamp).

**Procedure**: NOT entered as a known-delta. Endpoint is excluded from the
compat surface entirely; only `SnapshotPreconditionTest` reads it via a
projection of the two contract-bearing fields. Do not add the endpoint back
to a compat test.

### 4. Real regression

Example: candidate's `/build-tools` returns an empty list for components that
inherit `BuildEnv` from `Defaults.groovy`, while baseline returns `[BuildEnv]`.

**Procedure**: this is a bug. Add a regression UT (e.g., `GitVsDbValidationTest`
VAL-XXX) that reproduces it deterministically against the candidate code path,
then fix the code. Do NOT enter as known-delta; the entry would mask the bug.

## Workflow for adding a known-delta entry

1. Confirm the diff is in category 1 (intentional v3 change). If it is in
   category 2/3/4, follow that category's procedure instead.
2. Ship the regression UT first; entry's `regressionTest` field is mandatory
   and must reference an existing test method.
3. Add the entry to `known-deltas-db.json` (db-mode; `known-deltas-git.json` stays empty — see "Per-mode known-deltas").
4. PR description justifies the intentional behavior change with a link to
   the relevant ADR / spec section / ticket.

## What to do when compat-test fails

`./gradlew :components-registry-compat-test:test` fails iff `activeTotal > 0`,
where `activeTotal = env-warnings + unsuppressed endpoint diffs`. Suppressed
records (matched known-deltas) never count.

Failure modes:

- **`SNAPSHOT_MISMATCH` active** → stands resolved to different VCS tags / revisions; not a code issue. Align by configuring matching `tagVersionPrefix` per env in `f1/service-config` or by waiting for both to pick up the same release tag.
- **(Historical) `CANDIDATE_NOT_DB_MODE`** → category is currently dormant on this branch (no DB value in `ServiceMode`). Operator must verify the candidate's read path (Git vs DB source) out-of-band before assuming a clean run means the schema-v2 DB read-path is validated.
- **`STRUCTURAL_DIFF` with hundreds/thousands of records on one endpoint** →
  almost certainly a mid-refresh race on candidate. Wait for `cacheUpdatedAt`
  stability and re-run.
- **A handful of `VALUE_DIFF` or `STATUS_CODE_DIFF` records on specific
  endpoints** → real regressions. Investigate, classify into category 1 or
  category 4, follow the corresponding procedure.
- **Extra `jira-component-version-ranges` / `maven-artifacts` views that differ
  ONLY in `versionRange` (two adjacent ranges with byte-identical payloads)** →
  a side effect of the base-row = open-upper amendment (2026-07, ADR-018 §2):
  when a component declares two ADJACENT version blocks with identical values,
  they were previously collapsed only because the oldest of them happened to seed
  the base; now that the newest block is the base, both older twins survive as
  separate override rows and enumerate as separate (identical) views. **Preferred
  fix: clean the redundant twin block in the source DSL (old CR) / the test
  fixture — merge the two identical adjacent ranges — NOT a resolver-side
  adjacent-view collapse** (a collapse in the read path was tried and rejected: it
  needs value-equality the resolved config objects don't cleanly provide and it
  regressed the `maven-artifacts` enumeration). The one-off scan
  `scan-open-upper-base-violations.sql` detects the related "open-upper
  SCALAR_OVERRIDE" residue of the OLD base form after migration.
